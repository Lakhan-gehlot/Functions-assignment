Common examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets. For an object to be iterable, its class must define either an __iter__() method, which returns an iterator, or a __getitem__() method, which allows access by sequential indices starting from zero.\n",

        "ANS:- In Python, a generator is a function that produces a sequence of values using the yield keyword, instead of returning a single value and terminating like a regular function. Generators are memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large or infinite data sets, because they generate values on demand, one at a time, rather than creating the entire sequence in memory at once.\n",
        "How Generators are Defined:\n",
        "A generator function is defined like a regular function, but instead of using return to send back a value, it uses yield. When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. This object is an iterator, and calling its next() method (or using it in a for loop) causes the generator function to execute until it hits a yield statement. The value yielded is then returned, and the generator's state is saved so that the next call to next() will resume execution from where it left off.\n",
